# UNIT 8 – Implementing Quantitative Risk Models

## Unit Overview
This unit focused on the practical application of Quantitative Risk Modelling (QRM) techniques to real-world problems. It built upon the theoretical foundations introduced in Unit 7 and demonstrated how methods such as Monte Carlo simulation, Bayesian modelling, and probabilistic state-transition models can be implemented to support risk-informed decision-making. Case studies were used to evaluate the effectiveness and limitations of these techniques in operational and cybersecurity contexts.

## Application of Quantitative Risk Modelling

Quantitative risk models enable organisations to estimate likelihoods and impacts numerically, supporting more informed decision-making under uncertainty. In this unit, QRM was applied to scenarios involving cybersecurity threats, business continuity, and social engineering attacks. These applications demonstrated how quantitative techniques can move beyond static risk scoring toward dynamic and evidence-based risk estimation.

## Monte Carlo Simulation in Practice
Monte Carlo simulation was examined as a practical tool for modelling uncertainty where multiple variables influence outcomes. By repeatedly sampling probability distributions, the method produces a range of possible outcomes rather than a single deterministic result. This approach is particularly valuable for estimating loss distributions and stress-testing assumptions.

However, the accuracy of Monte Carlo models is highly dependent on the quality of input data and the validity of assumptions. Poorly defined distributions or unrealistic parameters can result in misleading outputs, reinforcing the need for transparency and validation.

## Bayesian and Probabilistic Modelling
Bayesian approaches were explored as a means of updating risk estimates as new evidence becomes available. This is particularly relevant in cybersecurity and social engineering contexts, where attacker behaviour and threat likelihoods evolve over time. Bayesian updating allows organisations to refine risk estimates dynamically rather than relying on static assessments.

## Collaborative Discussion Contribution – Social Engineering Threat Modelling
As part of this unit, I reviewed and reflected on the study by Aijaz and Nazir (2024), which models social engineering threats using Attack Trees and Markov Chain Models. The discussion highlighted the challenges of modelling human behaviour, persuasion techniques, and attacker decision-making processes.

I contributed by analysing how Attack Tree Models support structured identification of attack paths, while Markov Chain Models estimate Attack Occurrence Probability (AOP) and Attack Success Probability (ASP) through state transitions. I also reflected on the limitations of these models, particularly their reliance on assumptions about attacker behaviour and transition probabilities. Peer discussion reinforced the importance of combining technical models with human-centric and organisational controls when mitigating social engineering risks.

## Critical Evaluation of QRM Techniques
This unit reinforced that quantitative models are decision-support tools rather than predictive guarantees. While probabilistic models provide numerical clarity, they can introduce a false sense of precision if uncertainties and assumptions are not explicitly communicated. Hybrid approaches that combine quantitative modelling with qualitative judgement and contextual awareness often provide the most effective risk insights.

## Personal Contribution and Reflection
I engaged with quantitative modelling exercises and collaborative discussions to critically evaluate how QRM techniques are implemented in practice. This unit strengthened my ability to assess model suitability, interpret probabilistic outputs, and communicate risk implications clearly. The learning gained directly informed my approach to later units involving business continuity planning and disaster recovery design.
