# UNIT 6 – The Practical Implications of Security and Risk Standards

## Unit Overview
This unit built upon the theoretical understanding of security and risk standards by examining their practical implementation within organisations. The focus was on GDPR-related case studies and the application of industry standards such as GDPR, PCI-DSS, and healthcare data protection frameworks. The unit emphasised how regulatory requirements translate into operational controls, compliance checks, and mitigation strategies.

## Review of GDPR and Industry Standards

### General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)
GDPR applies to organisations processing personal data of individuals within the European Union. Key obligations include lawful processing, data minimisation, accountability, breach notification, and protection of data subject rights. Failure to comply can result in significant financial penalties and reputational damage.

### PCI-DSS
PCI-DSS is mandatory for organisations handling payment card data. It focuses on secure payment processing through encryption, network segmentation, access control, and regular security testing.

### Healthcare and Public-Sector Standards
In healthcare and public-sector environments, GDPR must be supported by additional sector-specific controls to ensure confidentiality, integrity, and availability of sensitive data. These standards emphasise system resilience, access logging, and incident response readiness.

## Application of Standards to Organisational Scenarios

### GDPR Applicability
Any organisation offering services to EU residents or processing EU personal data must comply with GDPR. Compliance includes maintaining records of processing activities, implementing appropriate technical and organisational measures, and appointing responsible data protection roles where required.

### Payment Processing (PCI-DSS)
Organisations accepting online or in-store card payments must comply with PCI-DSS. Compliance can be validated through vulnerability scanning, penetration testing, and third-party audits, depending on transaction volume.

### Evaluating Compliance
Compliance can be assessed through internal audits, policy reviews, technical testing, and staff awareness training. Evidence includes documented procedures, audit logs, access control records, and incident response plans.

## GDPR Case Study Evaluation

A GDPR case study was reviewed to assess how data protection failures occur in practice. The case demonstrated how insufficient access controls and inadequate staff awareness led to unauthorised data exposure. Resolution involved regulatory intervention, corrective action plans, and improved governance.

### Recommended Mitigations
- Conduct regular data protection impact assessments (DPIAs)
- Implement role-based access control and encryption
- Provide staff training on data handling and breach reporting
- Maintain clear incident response and breach notification procedures

These mitigations align with GDPR’s accountability and security principles.

## Critical Evaluation
While standards such as GDPR and PCI-DSS provide strong regulatory frameworks, they can impose operational and financial burdens, particularly on smaller organisations. Compliance-driven approaches risk prioritising documentation over actual risk reduction if not implemented thoughtfully. Effective compliance requires integrating standards into everyday operational processes rather than treating them as isolated regulatory tasks.

## Personal Contribution
I contributed to the analysis of GDPR case studies and participated in discussions evaluating how organisations could meet regulatory requirements through practical mitigations. This included identifying compliance gaps and recommending proportionate controls based on organisational size and risk exposure.

## Reflection
This unit enhanced my understanding of how abstract regulatory requirements are operationalised within real organisations. It reinforced the importance of aligning legal compliance with practical risk management controls and influenced my approach to later assessments involving standards-driven mitigation strategies.

## Learning Application

Unit 6 explored the **practical implications of applying security and risk standards** within organisational contexts, including how standards such as ISO/IEC 27005, ISO 31000, and the NIST Risk Management Framework (RMF) influence the design and implementation of risk assessment and treatment processes. This unit emphasised not just the theoretical aspects of standards, but their **operational and organisational impacts**, including alignment with compliance obligations, integration with existing processes, and the need for stakeholder engagement.

The learning from Unit 6 directly informed my approach to **adapting industry standards to practical project needs** in the team Risk Identification Report. In particular, it shaped how we interpreted and applied the ISO/IEC 27005 risk management principles in a way that was feasible for a small business environment, and how we aligned our process outputs with expectations for documentation and decision-making. This unit helped consolidate my understanding of why standards are not just reference materials but **practical guides** that influence risk assessment structuring, stakeholder communication, and the justification of control decisions.
