## Unit 2 – Users, Assessments and the Risk Management Process

### Unit Overview  
Unit 2 develops a deeper understanding of the Risk Management Process (RMP) by examining the differences between qualitative and quantitative risk assessment approaches and the importance of user participation. The unit highlights how assessment choices influence risk prioritisation and decision-making, and why stakeholder involvement is critical to producing meaningful and actionable risk outcomes within organisations.

**Seminar Preparation / Workshop Activity**  
I prepared written responses for the Unit 2 seminar, focusing on how different assessment approaches and user participation affect the effectiveness of the risk management process.

### Individual Contribution  
I authored the initial discussion post comparing qualitative and quantitative risk assessment methods and explaining the role of users in shaping risk identification and mitigation. I also responded to peers with academically supported arguments and completed the seminar preparation activities, demonstrating independent engagement with the unit content.

### Critical Reflection  
Unit 2 reinforced that risk assessment is not purely a technical exercise but a socio-technical process shaped by stakeholder input. I learned that qualitative methods are particularly valuable when historical data is limited, while quantitative approaches pro

## Unit 2 – Learning Application

Unit 2 emphasised the role of **users, assessments, and systematic processes** in effective risk management, including how risk assessments guide decision-making by analysing likelihood and impact, and how users at different levels interact with risk controls (e.g., internal auditors ensuring risk management effectiveness across organisational activities). A risk management process typically involves establishing context, identifying risks, assessing likelihood and impact, and selecting appropriate risk responses, which ensures risks are managed in a structured and repeatable way. :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}

Learning from Unit 2 directly informed my approach to the **risk assessment methodology** used in the team project. Specifically, it reinforced why risk assessments should be systematic and user-aware, considering inputs from multiple stakeholders when identifying critical assets and potential threats. This guided decisions on risk scoring and the categorisation of risks in the current business assessment, ensuring that assessment outputs were relevant to both technical and operational stakeholders involved in the project.
