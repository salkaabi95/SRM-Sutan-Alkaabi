## Unit 3 – Introduction to Threat Modelling and Management

### Unit Overview  
Unit 3 introduces the principles of threat modelling and management, focusing on the distinction between threats and vulnerabilities and the importance of structured threat analysis. The unit reviews established threat modelling techniques such as STRIDE, DREAD, attack trees, and hybrid approaches like PASTA. It also explores guidance and “cookbooks” that support the selection of appropriate threat modelling methods based on system context and risk profile.

### Artefacts  

**Collaborative Discussion Summary**  
This artefact summarises my contribution to the ongoing collaborative discussion, where I linked risk concepts from Units 1 and 2 to threat modelling approaches, highlighting how digitalisation can expand the attack surface.

### Individual Contribution  
I actively contributed to the collaborative discussion by applying threat modelling concepts to real-world digitalisation scenarios. I independently analysed multiple threat modelling frameworks, comparing their strengths and limitations, and documented these insights as part of my learning artefacts for this unit.

### Critical Reflection  
Unit 3 significantly deepened my understanding of how threats differ from vulnerabilities and why structured threat modelling is essential for effective risk management. I learned that frameworks such as STRIDE are valuable for systematically identifying threat categories, while attack trees provide a more detailed, attacker-centric view of exploitation paths. This unit highlighted that no single technique is universally sufficient, reinforcing the importance of selecting or combining models based on context. These insights informed my later project work by encouraging a layered and methodical approach to threat identification.
