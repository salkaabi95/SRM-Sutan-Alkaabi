# UNIT 9 – Risk, Business Continuity and Disaster Recovery

## Unit Overview
This unit focused on Business Continuity (BC) and Disaster Recovery (DR) as critical components of effective security and risk management. The unit examined how organisations prepare for, respond to, and recover from disruptive events, with emphasis on Business Impact Analysis (BIA), Recovery Time Objectives (RTO), and Recovery Point Objectives (RPO). Emerging trends in information risk management were also considered.

## Business Continuity and Disaster Recovery Concepts

Business Continuity refers to an organisation’s ability to maintain essential functions during and after a disruptive incident, while Disaster Recovery focuses on restoring IT systems and data following such events. Together, BC and DR ensure operational resilience and minimise financial, reputational, and regulatory impacts.

Key concepts explored include:
- **Business Impact Analysis (BIA):** Identifies critical business functions and the consequences of disruption.
- **Recovery Time Objective (RTO):** The maximum acceptable time to restore a service.
- **Recovery Point Objective (RPO):** The maximum acceptable amount of data loss measured in time.

## Application of BC and DR Planning

BC and DR planning were applied to organisational scenarios involving system outages, cyber incidents, and physical disruptions. By defining RTOs and RPOs, organisations can select appropriate recovery solutions such as backups, redundancy, or cloud-based disaster recovery services. This unit demonstrated how recovery requirements must align with business priorities rather than purely technical considerations.

## Disaster Recovery Strategies

Different DR strategies were reviewed, including:
- **Cold standby:** Low cost but long recovery times.
- **Warm standby:** Balanced cost and recovery capability.
- **Hot standby:** High availability with minimal downtime but higher cost.

The selection of a DR strategy depends on organisational risk tolerance, regulatory requirements, and resource availability.

## Critical Evaluation of BC and DR Approaches

While BC and DR planning significantly enhance organisational resilience, they also introduce challenges. Overly ambitious RTOs and RPOs can be costly and difficult to achieve, particularly for smaller organisations. Conversely, insufficient recovery planning increases exposure to prolonged outages and regulatory non-compliance. This unit reinforced the importance of proportionate, risk-based continuity planning rather than one-size-fits-all solutions.

## Personal Contribution
I engaged with continuity planning concepts by analysing how BIAs inform recovery objectives and how different DR strategies align with business needs. I contributed to discussions evaluating trade-offs between cost, availability, and resilience, particularly in relation to cyber-related disruptions.

## Reflection
This unit deepened my understanding of organisational resilience and highlighted the strategic importance of BC and DR planning within security and risk management. I learned that effective recovery planning requires collaboration between technical and business stakeholders and must be continuously reviewed as organisational dependencies evolve. These insights informed my later work on disaster recovery design and vendor resilience.
