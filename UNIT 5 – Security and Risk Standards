Individual Contribution

I analysed applicable frameworks for different organisational contexts and contributed recommendations to the module wiki.

This unit demonstrated how standards translate risk theory into operational controls. I learned that while compliance does not guarantee security, standards such as ISO 27001 and ISO 31000 provide a critical baseline for governance, accountability, and continuous improvement.
