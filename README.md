Security and Risk Management – e-Portfolio

Student Name: Sultan Alkaabi
Module: Security and Risk Management

Submission Overview

This GitHub repository constitutes my e-portfolio submission for the Security and Risk Management module. The portfolio has been organised to present my learning and development across the duration of the module in a clear, structured, and logically organised manner, in line with the assessment criteria.

The repository demonstrates:

A final critical reflective piece, written using the WHAT / SO WHAT / NOW WHAT reflective framework

Evidence of team-based project work, including clear explanation of my individual contributions

Evidence of individual project work, demonstrating independent application of security and risk management concepts

Supporting artefacts mapped across Units 1–12, showing progression of learning throughout the module

Appropriate and consistent use of academic literature, professional standards, and frameworks

All content is clearly labelled to distinguish between individual and collaborative work, ensuring transparency and compliance with academic integrity requirements.

The structure of this repository is designed to allow assessors to easily locate and review each component of the e-portfolio without unnecessary navigation or ambiguity.
