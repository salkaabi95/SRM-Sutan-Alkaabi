Unit Overview

This unit explored practical DR designs, cloud solutions, and vendor lock-in risks.

Artefacts

DR architecture sketch

Vendor lock-in analysis

Reflection

I learned that cloud-based DR solutions offer resilience but introduce dependency risks. Evaluating trade-offs between cost, availability, and control was critical in designing realistic DR strategies.
