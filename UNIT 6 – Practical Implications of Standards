Individual Contribution

I contributed to the GDPR case analysis and participated in the team risk assessment for the Pampered Pets scenario.

Reflection

This unit highlighted how regulatory risk intersects with operational and reputational risk. Analysing GDPR cases showed how minor procedural failures can lead to severe consequences. This understanding strengthened my ability to integrate legal considerations into broader risk management strategies.
