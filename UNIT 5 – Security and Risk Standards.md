# UNIT 5 – Introduction to Security and Risk Standards in Industry and the Enterprise

## Unit Overview
This unit examined the role of security and risk standards in supporting effective security and risk management within organisations. It focused on how standards influence risk assessments, regulatory compliance, and threat modelling across different industries, with emphasis on internationally recognised frameworks such as ISO 31000, ISO/IEC 27001, GDPR, and PCI-DSS.

## Key Security and Risk Standards

### ISO 31000 – Risk Management Guidelines
ISO 31000 provides a principles-based framework for identifying, analysing, and treating risks across organisational contexts. It promotes integration with governance structures and continuous improvement through iterative risk assessment cycles.

### ISO/IEC 27001 – Information Security Management Systems
ISO/IEC 27001 specifies requirements for establishing and maintaining an Information Security Management System (ISMS). It supports structured risk treatment by aligning security controls with organisational objectives and identified threats.

### General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)
GDPR establishes legal requirements for the processing of personal data within the European Union and for organisations offering services to EU residents. It emphasises accountability, data minimisation, and mandatory breach notification.

### PCI-DSS
PCI-DSS applies to organisations that process, store, or transmit cardholder data. It mandates technical and organisational controls designed to reduce the risk of payment card fraud and data breaches.

Together, these standards support confidentiality, integrity, availability, and legal compliance across enterprise systems.

## Application of Standards to Different Organisations

### International Bank
An international bank would be subject to ISO/IEC 27001, ISO 31000, PCI-DSS, and GDPR. These standards collectively address financial data protection, operational resilience, regulatory compliance, and cyber risk management.

### Large Hospital
Hospitals must comply with GDPR due to the processing of sensitive personal and health data. ISO/IEC 27001 supports the protection of electronic health records, while risk assessments must also consider patient safety and system availability.

### Large Food Manufacturing Organisation
ISO 31000 supports enterprise-wide risk governance, while HACCP principles address food safety risks. ISO/IEC 27001 becomes relevant where digital supply chains, ERP systems, or cloud platforms are used.

This comparison demonstrates that security standards must be selected and applied based on organisational context, regulatory exposure, and operational risk.

## Critical Evaluation of Security Standards
While standards provide consistency and regulatory alignment, they also present limitations. ISO frameworks are intentionally flexible, which can lead to inconsistent implementation if not supported by strong governance. Compliance-driven approaches risk becoming checklist-focused rather than risk-focused if organisational culture does not support continuous improvement.

Additionally, maintaining certification (such as ISO/IEC 27001) requires ongoing resources and expertise, which may challenge smaller organisations. This highlights the importance of proportional, risk-based implementation rather than rigid adherence.

## Personal Contribution
I contributed to analysing how security standards apply to different organisational contexts and participated in discussions evaluating GDPR case studies. My focus was on identifying appropriate mitigations and understanding how regulatory requirements influence practical risk management decisions.

## Reflection
This unit strengthened my understanding of how security and risk standards operate as both technical and legal mechanisms. The knowledge gained informed my approach to later risk assessments and the final project, particularly in aligning mitigations with recognised standards and regulatory expectations.
