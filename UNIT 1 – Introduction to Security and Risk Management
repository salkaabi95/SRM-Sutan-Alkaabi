## Unit 1 – Introduction to Security and Risk Management

### Unit Overview  
Unit 1 introduces core definitions and concepts of security and risk management, including common definitions of risk, threats, and vulnerabilities. It explains how risk assessments are structured and why understanding risk terminology is essential before applying qualitative or quantitative methods. These foundational concepts lay the basis for later units.

### Artefacts
- **Discussion post:** Screenshot or copied text responding to the forum prompt on risk definitions.
- **Peer responses:** Screenshots or text showing engagement with academic sources.
- **Wiki contribution:** Link or snippet where I defined key SRM terms.

### Individual Contribution
I authored the initial discussion post on risk definitions and responded to at least two peers using references from ISO 31000 and academic sources. I also contributed to the Module Wiki by defining terminology relevant to Unit 1.

### Critical Reflection  
Unit 1 helped me understand that risk is not just a chance of loss, but the *effect of uncertainty on objectives*, as defined in ISO 31000. This distinction between probability and impact made me appreciate the complexity of the risk management process and why consistent terminology is essential. Early engagement with peers through discussion reinforced that operationalising these definitions requires careful thought and shared understanding. This reflective start shaped my approach to risk modelling in later units.
