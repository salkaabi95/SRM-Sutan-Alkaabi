Reflection

This unit provided a foundational understanding of how risk is conceptualised and managed in information systems. I learned that risk is not solely about probability but also about uncertainty, impact, and context. The distinction between qualitative and quantitative assessments clarified why many organisations adopt hybrid approaches when data is limited. This learning shaped my later work by ensuring that all subsequent risk assessments were grounded in structured, standards-based processes rather than intuition.
