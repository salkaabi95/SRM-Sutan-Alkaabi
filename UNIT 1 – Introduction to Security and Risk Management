UNIT 1 – Introduction to Security and Risk Management
Unit Overview

This unit introduced foundational definitions of security and risk management, including threats, vulnerabilities, and uncertainty. It established the basis for qualitative and quantitative risk assessment and introduced recognised risk management standards.

Individual Contribution

I authored the initial discussion post and engaged critically with peer responses, integrating academic literature to support arguments around risk and accountability.

Reflection

This unit clarified that risk is not merely the likelihood of harm, but a combination of uncertainty, impact, and context. Understanding this distinction helped me appreciate why structured frameworks such as ISO 31000 are necessary to avoid subjective or inconsistent risk decisions. The introduction to qualitative and quantitative assessment approaches influenced my later methodology choices, particularly when assessing organisations with limited historical data. This unit established the conceptual foundation for all subsequent risk analysis tasks in the module.
