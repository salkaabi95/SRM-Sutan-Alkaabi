Individual Contribution

I developed a threat model based on the workshop scenario and evaluated publicly available threat modelling tools.

Reflection

Applying threat modelling tools revealed their strengths and limitations. While frameworks like MITRE ATT&CK provide structured threat intelligence, they require contextual understanding to remain effective. This unit reinforced that tooling alone cannot replace analyst judgement, particularly in complex socio-technical systems.
