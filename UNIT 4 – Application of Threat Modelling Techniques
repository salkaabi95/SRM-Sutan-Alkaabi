Reflection

Applying threat models to realistic scenarios demonstrated the gap between theory and practice. Tools such as MITRE ATT&CK provided structured threat intelligence, but I also recognised their limitations when contextual business knowledge is missing. This reinforced the importance of human judgement alongside tooling.
