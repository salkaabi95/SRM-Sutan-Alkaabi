Summary post contribution

Individual Contribution

I analysed multiple threat modelling frameworks and contributed to the collaborative discussion summary.

Reflection

This unit highlighted the value of threat modelling as a proactive security practice. Comparing different models showed that no single framework is universally applicable. Instead, model selection must reflect system complexity, attacker capability, and organisational goals. This insight guided my later use of hybrid approaches when analysing real-world systems.
