Critical Reflection on Security and Risk Management
WHAT? – Description of the Learning Experience
The Security and Risk Management module provided a structured and progressive exploration of how security risks are identified, analysed, and managed within organisational contexts. Across the module, learning developed from foundational concepts of risk and security governance to advanced applications involving quantitative risk modelling, business continuity, disaster recovery, and future trends in security and risk management.
A core learning activity within the module involved two major projects: a team-based Risk Identification Report and an individual Risk Assessment and Business Continuity Strategy. The team project focused on assessing the current and future risks of a small business undergoing digital transformation, while the individual project required an independent, quantitative evaluation of risks associated with digitalisation and global supply chain expansion. Together, these projects allowed theoretical concepts introduced throughout the module to be applied in both collaborative and independent contexts.
Within the team project, my primary responsibilities included the risk assessment of the current business, methodology selection and justification, threat and risk modelling, and the identification of mitigations for current risks. I also contributed to the threat modelling sections and the final recommendations, ensuring that risks were prioritised and addressed using recognised industry standards. Collaboration with teammates was conducted primarily through scheduled Zoom meetings, where findings were discussed and refined.
The individual project required me to independently apply quantitative risk modelling techniques and design a business continuity and disaster recovery strategy suitable for a reputation-sensitive organisation. This work demanded a higher level of analytical depth and personal accountability, as all modelling assumptions, calculations, and recommendations were my sole responsibility.

SO WHAT? – Critical Analysis and Learning
Security and Risk Management Process
One of the most significant learning outcomes from this module was developing a clear understanding of how structured risk management frameworks operate in practice. During the team project, I selected and justified a hybrid qualitative–semi-quantitative risk assessment methodology, informed by ISO/IEC 27005 and NIST SP 800-30. This approach was particularly appropriate because the organisation lacked sufficient historical incident data to support fully quantitative analysis. Applying likelihood and impact scoring enabled clear prioritisation of risks while remaining practical and repeatable, reflecting real-world constraints faced by small and medium-sized organisations (ISO, 2018; NIST, 2018).
Threat modelling activities highlighted that risks rarely exist in isolation. For example, cyber risks such as malware and data breaches were closely linked to human factors, outdated systems, and weak governance processes. This reinforced the importance of adopting a holistic, context-driven approach to security and risk management, as emphasised by ISO 31000, rather than focusing exclusively on technical controls.
The individual project deepened this learning by introducing quantitative risk modelling techniques, including Fault Tree Analysis and Monte Carlo simulation. These methods allowed uncertainty and interdependencies to be modelled more rigorously, producing probability-based results that are more meaningful for executive decision-making. This experience demonstrated the limitations of purely qualitative approaches when managing complex, cyber-physical and supply-chain risks, and highlighted the value of quantitative techniques when sufficient assumptions and data are available.
Individual Contribution and Behaviour
Reflecting on my individual contributions, I recognised that I was confident in analytical and structured tasks, such as risk identification, modelling, and mitigation design. However, translating theoretical guidance into recommendations that were realistic for organisations with limited resources was challenging. Addressing this required critical engagement with standards documentation and iterative refinement of assumptions, which strengthened my ability to justify decisions using evidence rather than intuition.
Emotionally, taking responsibility for methodology selection during the team project created a sense of pressure, as this decision shaped the credibility of the entire assessment. Initially, this uncertainty affected my confidence, but it ultimately encouraged a more disciplined and reflective approach to decision-making. Peer discussions during Zoom meetings provided reassurance and constructive challenge, helping me validate assumptions and refine risk prioritisation.
The individual project further amplified this sense of accountability, as there was no opportunity to rely on team consensus. This experience improved my confidence in making independent, evidence-based security decisions and reinforced the importance of transparency when communicating assumptions and limitations.
Experience as a Development Team Member
Working as part of a development team highlighted the importance of communication and coordination in achieving effective security outcomes. Zoom-based collaboration enabled real-time discussion and rapid resolution of disagreements, particularly around risk severity and mitigation feasibility. While reliance on synchronous communication occasionally slowed progress, it also ensured shared understanding and alignment across the team.
This experience reinforced that security and risk management is inherently collaborative, requiring negotiation between technical feasibility, business priorities, and risk appetite. Learning through interaction and reflection aligns with experiential learning theory, which emphasises that knowledge is constructed through shared experience and critical reflection (Kolb, 1984).

NOW WHAT? – Impact on Professional and Personal Development
This module has had a significant impact on both my professional and personal development. Professionally, I have developed practical skills in risk assessment, threat modelling, quantitative analysis, and business continuity planning, supported by recognised standards such as ISO/IEC 27005, ISO 22301, and the NIST Risk Management Framework. These skills are directly transferable to roles in security governance, risk management, and compliance.
I now have a clearer understanding of how to select appropriate risk management approaches based on organisational context, data availability, and stakeholder needs. In future projects, I will prioritise early stakeholder engagement to ensure that risk assumptions and mitigation strategies are proportionate and aligned with business objectives. I also intend to further develop my quantitative modelling skills to support more data-driven decision-making in complex environments.
On a personal level, this module increased my confidence in making and defending security-related decisions under uncertainty. It also reinforced the value of reflection, collaboration, and continuous improvement as essential components of effective professional practice. Overall, the learning experience has reshaped how I approach security and risk management, emphasising the need for structured, evidence-based, and context-aware decision-making.
