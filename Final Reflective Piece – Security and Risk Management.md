# Final Reflective Piece – Security and Risk Management

## WHAT – Overview of the Learning Experience

This module provided a comprehensive exploration of Security and Risk Management (SRM), combining theoretical foundations with practical application across qualitative, quantitative, regulatory, and strategic domains. The learning journey progressed from fundamental concepts of risk and security management to advanced topics such as quantitative risk modelling, disaster recovery design, and future trends in SRM. Central to the module was a team-based case study involving the digitalisation of a small business, which required the application of structured risk assessment methodologies, threat modelling techniques, and standards-based mitigations.

Throughout the module, I engaged in collaborative discussions, practical modelling exercises, and applied analysis aligned with real-world organisational challenges. These activities culminated in an executive summary assessment and the development of this e-portfolio, which documents both my technical development and reflective learning across all twelve units.

## SO WHAT – Analysis and Critical Reflection

One of the most significant insights gained from this module was the importance of **context-driven risk management**. Early units challenged my initial assumption that risk management is primarily a technical activity. Instead, I learned that effective SRM integrates organisational objectives, human behaviour, regulatory obligations, and uncertainty into decision-making processes (Aven & Thekdi, 2025).

The distinction between qualitative and quantitative risk assessment approaches was particularly impactful. While qualitative methods offer accessibility and stakeholder engagement, they are limited by subjectivity. Quantitative Risk Modelling (QRM), explored in depth in Units 7 and 8, introduced probabilistic approaches such as Monte Carlo simulation and Bayesian inference. These techniques enhanced my ability to evaluate uncertainty numerically; however, they also highlighted the dangers of false precision. I developed a critical appreciation that quantitative models are decision-support tools rather than predictive truths, reinforcing arguments presented in contemporary risk science literature.

Collaborative discussions played a crucial role in deepening my understanding. For example, in Unit 7, I critically evaluated the limitations of the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS), drawing on peer-reviewed research that demonstrates inconsistencies in scoring outcomes. Engaging with peers allowed me to synthesise technical critique with quantitative alternatives such as FAIR and Bayesian models. This experience strengthened my analytical confidence and demonstrated the value of peer perspectives in refining professional judgement.

The team-based risk assessment of the Pampered Pets case study was another pivotal learning experience. Working collaboratively to assess both the current and digitalised states of the business required negotiation, role clarity, and evidence-based reasoning. I contributed to methodology selection, threat identification, and mitigation design, ensuring alignment with ISO 31000 and NIST SP 800-30. This process revealed the complexity of balancing cybersecurity risks, supply chain resilience, regulatory compliance, and business growth objectives. It also highlighted how communication and consensus-building are as important as technical accuracy in risk management practice.

Emotionally, the project initially felt challenging due to its breadth and the need to integrate multiple frameworks. However, as the module progressed, my confidence increased significantly. Structured methodologies, clear standards, and iterative reflection helped transform uncertainty into analytical clarity. I also became more comfortable engaging critically with academic literature rather than treating sources as unquestionable authority.

## NOW WHAT – Professional and Personal Development

Looking forward, this module has had a clear impact on my professional development. I now approach security and risk management as a **strategic advisory function**, rather than a purely technical discipline. The ability to select appropriate risk methodologies, justify assumptions, and communicate uncertainty to non-technical stakeholders is a skill set I intend to apply in professional practice.

The emphasis on standards such as ISO 27001, GDPR, and PCI-DSS has strengthened my understanding of regulatory alignment and governance. I am now better equipped to assess compliance not as a checkbox exercise, but as a risk-informed process that supports organisational resilience. Similarly, the exploration of Business Continuity and Disaster Recovery planning has enhanced my ability to design recovery strategies aligned with business priorities, RTOs, and RPOs.

The final units on emerging trends and the Great Debate reinforced the importance of adaptability in SRM. I concluded that adaptive and integrated risk management frameworks will be the most influential trend over the next five years, as they enable organisations to incorporate AI, behavioural insights, and regulatory change within a single governance structure. This perspective reflects my evolving professional identity as a risk practitioner capable of bridging technical, human, and strategic considerations.

On a personal level, this module improved my critical writing, reflective thinking, and collaboration skills. Maintaining the e-portfolio encouraged continuous reflection rather than retrospective justification, aligning with best practice in professional learning. Overall, this module has provided a strong foundation for future roles in cybersecurity, risk management, or governance, and has reshaped how I evaluate and communicate risk in complex environments.
