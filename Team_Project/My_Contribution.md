My Individual Contribution to the Team Project

The development team project involved producing a comprehensive Risk Identification Report for an organisation undergoing digital transformation. The work was completed collaboratively; however, specific responsibilities were clearly allocated within the team.

My primary individual contributions focused on the risk assessment of the current business environment. In particular, I was responsible for:

Selecting and justifying the risk assessment methodology, including the adoption of a hybrid qualitative–semi-quantitative approach aligned with ISO/IEC 27005 and NIST SP 800-30

Conducting threat and risk modelling for existing business operations, identifying cyber, operational, and human-related threats

Assessing risks using likelihood and impact scoring to support prioritisation

Proposing mitigation strategies for current risks, ensuring they were proportionate, practical, and aligned with recognised security standards

Contributing to the final recommendations section to ensure consistency between identified risks and proposed controls

Throughout the project, I actively participated in team discussions and decision-making via scheduled Zoom meetings. These sessions were used to review findings, challenge assumptions, and align individual contributions into a coherent final report. Feedback from team members was incorporated into my work, particularly in refining risk prioritisation and mitigation feasibility.

This contribution demonstrates my ability to apply security and risk management principles within a collaborative development environment while maintaining responsibility for defined analytical tasks.
