Individual Contribution

I analysed how quantitative models support decision-making in security contexts.

Implementing models revealed the importance of aligning mathematical outputs with business impact. Quantitative risk models are most valuable when they support prioritisation and policy decisions rather than acting as purely academic exercises.
