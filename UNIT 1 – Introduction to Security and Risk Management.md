## Unit 1 – Introduction to Security and Risk Management

### Unit Overview  
Unit 1 introduces the foundational concepts of Security and Risk Management (SRM). It explores different definitions of risk, core SRM concepts such as threats and vulnerabilities, and the stages of the risk management process. The unit also distinguishes between qualitative and quantitative approaches to risk assessment and introduces commonly used security and risk standards. This unit establishes the conceptual baseline for all subsequent technical and analytical work within the module.

### Individual Contribution  
I authored the initial discussion post responding to the Unit 1 case study, focusing on risk definitions and the implications of technology-driven decision-making. I also engaged with peer responses and contributed academically referenced definitions to the module wiki, reinforcing shared understanding of SRM fundamentals.

### Critical Reflection  
Unit 1 clarified that risk is not simply the probability of an adverse event, but the *effect of uncertainty on objectives*, as defined by ISO 31000. This distinction reshaped my understanding of risk management as a structured, context-dependent process rather than an ad-hoc judgment. Engaging in discussion highlighted how inconsistent definitions of risk can undermine effective mitigation strategies. This foundational insight influenced my later work, particularly in justifying assessment methodologies and aligning technical risk analysis with organisational objectives.
