Reflection

This unit highlighted that risk management is a socio-technical process rather than a purely technical one. I learned that excluding users from assessments often leads to ineffective or rejected mitigations. Understanding the strengths and weaknesses of qualitative versus quantitative approaches helped me justify methodology choices later in the module, particularly when dealing with SMEs lacking historical data.
