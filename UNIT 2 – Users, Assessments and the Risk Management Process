Individual Contribution

I contributed peer responses focusing on mitigation strategies and completed seminar activities analysing AI-supported risk assessment.

Reflection

This unit demonstrated that effective risk management depends heavily on stakeholder involvement. I learned that excluding users often results in impractical or rejected mitigations, regardless of technical accuracy. Comparing qualitative and quantitative approaches highlighted why hybrid models are commonly adopted in practice. This understanding directly informed my later risk assessments, where I justified methodological choices based on organisational maturity and data availability.
