Individual Project Summary

This individual project focused on conducting an independent risk assessment and business continuity strategy for an organisation undergoing digitalisation and global supply chain expansion. The purpose of the project was to evaluate risks to product quality, system availability, and operational resilience, and to propose evidence-based mitigation and recovery strategies suitable for a reputation-sensitive organisation.

The project was completed independently, with full responsibility for methodology selection, analysis, modelling, and recommendations. Quantitative risk modelling techniques were applied to assess complex, interdependent risks associated with automated systems, international suppliers, and digital infrastructure. In particular, Fault Tree Analysis (FTA) was used to decompose high-impact failure scenarios, while Monte Carlo simulation was employed to model uncertainty across supply chain and operational variables.

The analysis was informed by recognised standards and professional guidance, including NIST SP 800-30 for risk assessment, NIST SP 800-34 for contingency planning, and ISO 22301 for business continuity management. These frameworks supported the definition of stringent Recovery Time Objectives (RTO) and Recovery Point Objectives (RPO), reflecting the organisation’s requirement for continuous availability and minimal data loss.

Based on the quantitative results, the project proposed a high-availability business continuity and disaster recovery (BC/DR) strategy, including multi-region deployment, near-synchronous data replication, automated failover, and regular recovery testing. Legal, ethical, and professional considerations, including data protection and organisational responsibility, were also explicitly addressed.

This project demonstrates my ability to independently apply advanced security and risk management concepts, integrate quantitative analysis into decision-making, and communicate complex risk information in a structured and professionally appropriate manner.
