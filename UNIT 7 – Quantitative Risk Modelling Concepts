Individual Contribution

I completed the quantitative exercises and critically evaluated CVSS limitations.

Reflection

This unit demonstrated the strengths of probability-based reasoning while highlighting the dangers of false precision. I learned that quantitative outputs are only meaningful when assumptions are explicit and validated. This insight informed my later modelling work and critical evaluations.
